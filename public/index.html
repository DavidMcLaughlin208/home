      content="My name is David McLaughlin. I'm a software developer who loves to solve challenging problems through collaboration and creative solutions. After getting a bachelors in Accounting and working for a year I discovered the art of programming. I pursued this new passion by attending DevBootcamp and then working for Amazon for 4 years as a Support Engineer and Software Developer. I was able to expand my skillset as well as my grasp of all the aspects of the software development job and lifecycle. In my free time I like to work on coding various simulations with a visual component."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
